#How to use
	
Most details and explanations will be discussed in the workshop. However, because these workshops are super intensive 1-day workshops, I recommand the attendents to at least read through the code prior for a basic understand of the code, that way we can discuss more advanced level topic during the workshop. 

+ HTML and CSS

	I recommand using the Chrome inspector to help you understand the structure of the HTML and its relationship with the CSS applied. 

+ JS

	The main JS file, **global.js**, is commented extensively to help you understand the code. **lib.js** is a utility library to help us with some of the things we need to do on the page. We will not go through **lib.js** in the workshop, but it is commented lightly and you are welcome use it for your own study.

	There are "Pop Quizes" in the **global.js** that will help to facillitate your research and help you learn the fundamental pricipals of Javascript faster.

+ PSD
	
	Be familar with the comcepts of Layer Comps and Layer Color Labeling. It will also be help to look into setting up Grid (both natively in Photoshop and using a third-party plugin and other grid libraries ) and Guides.
